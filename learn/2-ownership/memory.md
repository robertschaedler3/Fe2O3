## The Stack

 <!--TODO: data layout on the stack  -->

Here's a program that defines a number `n` and calls a function `plus_one` on `n`.

```rust
fn main() {
    let n = 5; // L1
    let y = plus_one(n); // L3
    println!("The value of y is: {y}");
}

fn plus_one(x: i32) -> i32 {
    x + 1 // L2
}
```

Variables live in frames. A frame is a mapping from variables to values within a single scope, such as a function. For example:

- The frame for main at location L1 holds n = 5.
- The frame for plus_one at L2 holds x = 5.
- The frame for main at location L3 holds n = 5; y = 6.

Frames are organized into a stack of currently-called-functions. For example, at L2 the frame for main sits above the frame for the called function plus_one. After a function returns, Rust deallocates the function's frame. (Deallocation is also called freeing or dropping, and we use those terms interchangeably.) This sequence of frames is called a stack because the most recent frame added is always the next frame freed.

Note: this memory model does not fully describe how Rust actually works! As we saw earlier with the assembly code, the Rust compiler might put n or x into a register rather than a stack frame. But that distinction is an implementation detail. It shouldn't change your understanding of safety in Rust, so we can focus on the simpler case of frame-only variables.

When an expression reads a variable, the variable's value is copied from its slot in the stack frame. For example, if we run this program:

```rust
let a = 5; // L1
let mut b = a; // L2
b += 1; // L3
```
The value of a is copied into b, and a is left unchanged, even after changing b.

## The Heap

<!-- TODO: Box<T>, String, etc -->

## `Box`s Live in the Heap

Copying data can take up a lot of memory. For example, here's a slightly different program. This program copies an array with 1 million elements:

```rust
let a = [0; 1_000_000]; // L1
let b = a; // L2
```

Observe that copying a into b causes the main frame to contain 2 million elements.

To transfer access to data without copying it, Rust uses pointers. A pointer is a value that describes a location in memory. The value that a pointer points-to is called its pointee. One common way to make a pointer is to allocate memory in the heap. The heap is a separate region of memory where data can live indefinitely. Heap data is not tied to a specific stack frame. Rust provides a construct called `Box` for putting data on the heap. For example, we can wrap the million-element array in `Box::new` like this:

```rust
let a = Box::new([0; 1_000_000]); // L1
let b = a; // L2
```

Observe that now, there is only ever a single array at a time. At L1, the value of a is a pointer (represented by dot with an arrow) to the array inside the heap. The statement let b = a copies the pointer from a into b, but the pointed-to data is not copied. Note that a is now grayed out because it has been moved â€” we will see what that means in a moment.
